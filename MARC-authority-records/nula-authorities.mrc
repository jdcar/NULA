GLBTQ families can take many forms, so comprehensibly defining the typical GLBTQ family can be slippery territory. While members of straight families are generally biologically linked, it is common for GLBTQ families to contain members who are not biologically connected but who form families via adoption or establish a family of choice, the latter by maintaining close ties within their lesbian and gay communities. ... Like straight parents, GLBTQ parents can be single or in couples, adoptive, or biological. Some biological GLBTQ parents have had children in the context of heterosexual marriages. In this case, continuing relationships with the other biological parent and her/his family of origin may need to be negotiated. Other biological GLBTQ parents choose to have children within the context of a same-sex partnership. In many lesbian couples, artificial insemination is the method of reproductive choice using either a known or an unknown donor.)  aI think I might have a GLBT family in my class--now what do I do?, viewed online June 26, 2012:bt.p. verso (GLBT-headed families)  aAll children, all families, viewed online June 26, 2012:bp. 2 (GLBT-headed families; GLBT families)  aArchives of sexual behavior, Dec. 2008, viewed online June 26, 2012:bp. 865 (sexual minority-headed families)  aSchool psychology review, v. 29, issue 2 (2000), viewed online June 26, 2012:bp. 207 (families headed by lesbian, gay, bisexual, and/or transgender parents) p. 208 (sexual minority-parented families)  aOCLC, June 26, 2012b(in titles: LGBT families; GLBT families; lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender families; gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender families; sexual-minority families; GLBT family studies; lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender family law)00770nz  a2200157n  4500001001700000005001700017008004100034010001700075035002200092035004300114040001800157150003100175450003400206667021500240670015700455988176636230244120130124132509.0121028 | anannbabn          |n ana     c  ash2012004224  a(DLC)sh2012004224  a(LIBRARY_OF_CONGRESS)98188977120000041  aWaUbengcDLC 7aLGBTQ people in art2local  aSexual minorities in artwnne  aMain entry changed to a local heading in 2021 from Sexual minorities in art to LGBTQ people in art by jdc following pattern from Homosaurus and the Chicago History Museum.
