GLBTQ families can take many forms, so comprehensibly defining the typical GLBTQ family can be slippery territory. While members of straight families are generally biologically linked, it is common for GLBTQ families to contain members who are not biologically connected but who form families via adoption or establish a family of choice, the latter by maintaining close ties within their lesbian and gay communities. ... Like straight parents, GLBTQ parents can be single or in couples, adoptive, or biological. Some biological GLBTQ parents have had children in the context of heterosexual marriages. In this case, continuing relationships with the other biological parent and her/his family of origin may need to be negotiated. Other biological GLBTQ parents choose to have children within the context of a same-sex partnership. In many lesbian couples, artificial insemination is the method of reproductive choice using either a known or an unknown donor.)
