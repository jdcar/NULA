# Northwestern University Local Authorities (NULA)

This is an ongoing list of the local authorities in the Northwestern University catalog and how they are mapped to LCSH.

This list owes a considerable amount to the work done to map LCSH headings at the Chicago History Museum: https://libguides.chicagohistory.org/blog/LCSH-to-Local-Headings-Map and the resources listed below. 

Questions are welcome and can be sent to jamie.carlstone@northwestern.edu

## Instructions
Northwestern uses Alma/Primo. 
1. A new authority vocabularly was defined in Alma. Instructions for that process are available here: https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Alma/Product_Documentation/010Alma_Online_Help_(English)/Metadata_Management/060Working_with_Authority_Records#Adding_a_Local_Authority_Definition 
2. The original heading from LCSH is copied from the Community Zone into the Institution Zone as NULA
3. MARC Record is edited according to same standards outlined in the CHM libguide
4. Normalization rule is run to flip LCSH to NULA. Normalization rules are included in this repository.
